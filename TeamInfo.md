## Project Summary

Our project is called Snipiddy! Simply enter your dietary restrictions — such as food allergies or irritating ingredients — along with any dietary preferences, diets, or caloric goals. Then, snap a photo of your menu and let our AI-powered scanner take over. Within seconds, it identifies potential allergens and offers dietary recommendations tailored to your needs, helping you make confident, informed food choices!
