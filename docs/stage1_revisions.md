# Revisions to Project Description
## What has changed in Stage 2 from Stage 1
1. We addressed the comments about the missing update and delete functionality. We have now specified that users can update their own profile information, including allergy information if, for example, their allergy severity changes. The user can also edit menus they uploaded for a restaurant. We have also specified similar delete functionality. Users can remove specific allergies and dietary restrictions from their profile if they made a mistake or if a personal change has happened. Users can also remove menus for restaurants from their profile.

2. We have updated our creative components. The map idea takes inspiration from our TA's recommendations. We have given our other creative components additional updates to better underscore their complexity.
